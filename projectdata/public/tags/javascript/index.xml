      <description>While protyping front end interfaces for responsive web applications, I frequently have to mock out the data interactions with static constants in my javascript that mock server requests and responses. This has several downsides: you cannot change the data in a demo situation, inserting real requests requires you to construct the remoteand the number of mocks can explode if you are trying to make a CRUD user interface.&#xA;DumbDB is a better way.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: With a fun algorithm, slight parameter tweaks lead to really different results, as I show in a work based on Elgar&amp;rsquo;s enigma variations.&#xA;A good piece of art compells you to understand the process that created it, whether it is the emotion of the composer, or the logic of the painter. A revlation while looking at a piece by Frank Stella made me understand the fundamental mechanism that was generating the work, and gave me confidence that I could recreate it.</description>
