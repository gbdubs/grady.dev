      <description>This project is one of my least exciting.
For an ML projectin in my AI class, we were assigned a task from Kaggle - answering multiple choice questions from a ninth grade science test.
Tensor flow had been released a week beforehand, and our team used it out of the box (with slight model refactoring) to train an ML model for the competition.
Ours did really well - top 10!</description>
