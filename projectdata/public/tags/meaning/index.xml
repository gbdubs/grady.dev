      <description>I recently did one of my favorite winter activities: a backcountry hut trip. A group of us schlepped a bunch of gear and food into the woods, and spent a few days living simply: heating a rustic cabin with firewood, melting snow for water, cooking, eating, and exploring the outdoors together. After a long weekend in this environment, I feel refreshed, relaxed, and more deeply connected with the friends that I accompanied.</description>
