      <description>When I worked in Counter-Abuse at Google, I found the largest issue we faced wasn&amp;rsquo;t malicious users, but poorly thought out product decisions, and business model constraints. It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; problems on platforms when you are constrained to cleanup, and can&amp;rsquo;t try to change why things keep spilling.
So when the Integrity Institutute (a small thinktank on content moderation issues, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been a member of for several years) sent out applications for visiting fellowships, I figured it was my chance to try to do something about it.</description>
