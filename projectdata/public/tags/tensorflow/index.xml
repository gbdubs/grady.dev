      <description>This project is one of my least exciting.&#xA;For an ML projectin in my AI class, we were assigned a task from Kaggle - answering multiple choice questions from a ninth grade science test.&#xA;Tensor flow had been released a week beforehand, and our team used it out of the box (with slight model refactoring) to train an ML model for the competition.&#xA;Ours did really well - top 10!</description>
