      <description>I like to build algorithmic art. The piece of it I find the most satisfying is the tinkering. You create some code to create an image from some settings, and then you play around with the settings to find the most satisfying combinations of inputs. This process isn&amp;rsquo;t technical, it&amp;rsquo;s just an expression of pure exploration and aesthetic judgement.
To allow everyone the joy of this kind of tinkering and discovery, a friend and I built ABOUND.</description>

      <description>This is work in progress, I&amp;rsquo;ve unpublished it for the time being in order to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally encourage anyone to use it. I&amp;rsquo;m changing data formats considerably and think it would be irresponsible to publish a tool as &amp;ldquo;helpful&amp;rdquo; if it is incompatible with the future version.
If you just want to create lambdas, the bash precursor to this project is up and very much still works: https://github.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite board games is Wingspan - an engine building game where you collect different species of birds. The game instilled an appreciation for our avian friends in me, and was my introduction to the wonderful world of birding.
As anyone who loves something desperately, the flaws in the wingspan game were more obvious to me than to most. The nest types were often incorrect. The clutch sizes capped out at six.</description>
