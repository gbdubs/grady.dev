      <description>Professor Linda Bui is a gem who really helped me enjoy the last class of my economics degree at Brandeis. So when she asked me if I could scrape all birth certificates from 1900 to 1950 in Massachusetts, I said “maybe”, rather than “no”.&#xA;I ended up using Matlab to do OCR with a combination of models for segmenting the certificates, and extracting the text for each field. The forms were either hand written or were machine printed, and I generated seperate models for each.</description>

      <description>I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem, and several topics within that space. My work was version controlled on github, and the final result is here.&#xA;I was first interested in the “Paths” invariant, which is incredibly powerful test for discerning between potentially isomorphic graphs in cubic (and fully paralellizable) time, and was originally theorized to be a solution to GI. The primary findings of my thesis were that:</description>
