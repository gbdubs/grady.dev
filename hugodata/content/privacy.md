I try to keep data collection to a minimum (here and in other projects).
The only data I collect on this site is through Cloudflare Analytics, 
which helps me understand how many people visit and which 
pages are popular. I use it out of the box without tracking any
additional identifying or personal information. 

Cloudflare does not store any data on browser to do it's analytics, but
it does send some minimal data about your browser and browsing when you
visit a page. 
Cloudflare describes this in 
[their Web Analytics documentation](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).

This policy may change over time with no notice.
