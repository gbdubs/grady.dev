My father is a professor at UVM, where he studies microbiology and molecular genetics.  In 2017 as a birthday present, I made him a website using Hugo, and the Academic theme. The theme I used was superb at providing most of the functionality required, but it took a few months of tinkering with my father to get everything exactly the way he wanted (publications ordered in certain ways, display settings configuration based, etc.)

The end result is lovely, and supremely updatable.  I wrote some scripts so that he can easily publish his work to the site (with two clicks) and veiw local edits as they happen (all without ever touching the command line).
