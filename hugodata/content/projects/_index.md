This is a messy and incomplete set of artifacts I've collected about things I've done, things I've made, and things I've played around with. 

Most projects and ideas I've tinkered with are half-baked, unlikely to ever be used, and in various states of disrepair. I'm still thankful for them, so in that spirit, I rarely take things off of this page, instead just sorting them toward the bottom.

If you're curious to learn more about one, want the source code, or have an idea or comment, I'd love to hear from you.
