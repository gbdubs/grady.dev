This is work in progress, I've unpublished it for the time being in order to make sure I don't accidentally encourage anyone to use it. I'm changing data formats considerably and think it would be irresponsible to publish a tool as "helpful" if it is incompatible with the future version.

If you just want to create lambdas, the bash precursor to this project is up and very much still works: [https://github.com/gbdubs/fns](https://github.com/gbdubs/fns).
