I took an architechure class in my Senior Year at Brandeis that awoke an asthetic sense I had not previously identified or listened to. In particular, the de-stijl primitive of intersecting planes struck a resonant chord in my sense of beauty.

That new asthetic, in combination with “draw me CSS” was the inspiration for V2 of my website - meant to resemble something in between a circut board, the maurader’s map, and the de-stijl classic “Composition in black, red, yellow and blue”.

Notable: the code that generates the site went through a series of refactors to try to make it more consistent across browsers and screen sizes. Underlying these problems was the fact that draw-me-css is too generalizable to be able to produce elegant code.
