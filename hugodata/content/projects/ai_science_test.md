This project is one of my least exciting.

For an ML projectin in my AI class, we were assigned a task from Kaggle - answering multiple choice questions from a ninth grade science test. 

Tensor flow had been released a week beforehand, and our team used it out of the box (with slight model refactoring) to train an ML model for the competition. 

Ours did really well - [top 10](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-allen-ai-science-challenge/leaderboard)!

Thanks Tensor Flow!
