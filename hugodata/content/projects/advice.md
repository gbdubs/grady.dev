In my time as a SWE I've been lucky to get the chance to mentor a large number of folks as they start
their careers in software. Over that time, I've picked up on some trends - habits, mindsets, and 
tactics that lead to growth as a SWE, and common patterns that lead people astray. 

I also frequently run into folks who have an intrest in software engineering, but have a hard time
envisioning a path for themselves within the industry. It's a crowded market of opinions, and it's hard
for someone without much experience in the field (or a trusted guide) to discern where they should
spend their time, what they need to know, or even what the job is actually like.

So, I decided to write up a document to try to make it a smaller lift to share some basic advice with
friends and aquaintances in this situation.

I wrote the first draft of it when a friend came to me with some questions about the field in mid-2023. Since
then, I've reused it with about a dozen folks, revising it each time to be shorter, more precise,
and trying to keep it up to date. My agreement with anyone I send it to is that they have to tell me 
where they think it is unclear, imprecise, or inaccurate - their feedback is the only way it can improve.

Feel free to forward it to folks, or leave comments or suggestions - it's globally suggestable. 
I would be curious to hear what other
folks (both experienced and not) think of it, and I hope to continue to have it evolve as a resource for
new SWEs.
