When I tried to update my website in December of 2017, I couldnâ€™t find the files anywhere on my laptop or github. This was a surprise, but one that I took as an opporotunity to recreate the site from scratch, using best practices from the start, and making some design changes. Luckily I later found these files, and posted them as V2 on this page.

The result was a nice site with a detailed portfolio section, some nice hugo-templated HTML, and the cute animations (which are NOT generated via draw-me-css). In this version of the site, I attempted to focus on how I could go beyond the original circut-board design of V2.

It has since been replaced by V4 (Sunrise), but you can still see the V3 version [here](/destijl/).

The result is a playful mix of formats that tries to stand out by being simple in design and complex in implementation.
