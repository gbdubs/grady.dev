## Let's Connect

If you have something to say, I want to hear from you!
The best way to connect is below but first...

### Please reach out if...

You have ideas, feedback, suggestions, or an argument you want to share.

You find a bug, flaw, or error in something that I built and want me to fix it.

You have a book or album suggestion

You want source code for almost anything on this site. I'll probably give
you it if you ask and have some plan for using it.

You are going to extend, remix, respond to or engage with the content of the 
site and want me to support your efforts - I assuredly will! 

### Please do not reach out if...

Please don't reach out with job or contracting opportunities, I'm happily 
employed and will be for the forseeable future.

Similarly, I've got quite a bit on my plate at the moment and I'm not able to
dedicate additional volunteer time to any recurring or longrunning technical projects,
though I am often willing to volunteer time to one-off, highly well scoped volunteer
requests.

Finally, *I do not vouch for folks I don't know* - please do not ask
for a referral or introduction (or connect solely with that intention) if we
do not yet know one another.

## Sounds good! 

Please reach out over email: [hello@grady.dev](mailto:hello@grady.dev).
