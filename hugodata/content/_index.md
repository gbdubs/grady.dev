Hi there! My name is Grady, and I'm a software engineer living and working in Colorado. Outside of work, I'm a tinkerer, a community builder, an outdoor junkie, and a bookworm.

I've been lucky to have a varied career spanning impact driven startups ([Ambrook](https://ambrook.com), current), big-tech ([Google](https://drive.google.com/)), the federal government ([FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/)), and running a small non-profit ([Silicon Ally](https://siliconally.org/)).

Projects, writing, and some art can be found in my [portfolio](/projects).
